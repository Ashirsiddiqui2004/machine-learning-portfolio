# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains my **machine learning and data science projects** built using Python.
The projects are organized to demonstrate my progression from **fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques**.

## 🧠 What this repository includes
- Supervised learning projects (Regression & Classification)
- Unsupervised learning projects
- End-to-end ML workflows
- Real-world datasets and problem statements

## 📁 Project Organization
Each project is placed in its own folder and typically includes:
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Dataset (if size permits)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Clear problem statement and results

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as my **machine learning portfolio** and will be updated continuously as I build and improve projects while learning AI/ML.
