## LSTM Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
handle sequential text data for sentiment classification.

### Problem
Classify movie-related sentences as positive or negative.

### Approach
- Text tokenization and padding
- Embedding layer for word representation
- LSTM layer for sequence memory
- Sigmoid output for binary classification

### Concepts Covered
- Sequential data
- Vanishing gradient problem
- Why LSTM is better than simple RNN
- Text classification using deep learning
