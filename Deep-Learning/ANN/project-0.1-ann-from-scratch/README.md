## Project 0.1 – ANN From Scratch (NumPy)

This project is part of my Deep Learning foundations.

I implemented a single-neuron Artificial Neural Network
from scratch using NumPy only to understand:

- Forward propagation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Backpropagation
- Gradient descent

### Purpose
This project focuses on understanding how neural networks
learn internally without using deep learning frameworks.

### Key Learnings
- How weight updates reduce loss
- Why gradients are required
- How sigmoid outputs probabilities

### Limitations
- Single neuron
- Educational purpose only
